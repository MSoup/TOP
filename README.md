This readme will serve as a mini log about things I've learned.

Nov 22 - Nov 28
- HTML, CSS review
- Replicate Google using only HTML/CSS
- Add GET functionality using only HTML to create search, image search, advanced search
- Learned about "Hoisting" in JS. 
-- Due to "hoisting," it is possible to use a function before it's defined. Hoisting only works with functions and variable declarations, but not initializations.
