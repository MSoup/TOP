The Odin Project

Nov 22 - Nov 28 - Project: Google Homepage
--
- HTML, CSS review
- Replicate Google using only HTML/CSS
- Add GET functionality using only HTML to create search, image search, advanced search
- Learned about "Hoisting" in JS. 
- Due to "hoisting," it is possible to use a function before it's defined. Hoisting only works with functions and variable declarations, but not initializations.

Nov 29 - Dec 5 - Project: Rock Paper Scissors
--
- Reviewed JS
- Finished first implementation of RPS logic 
- require('./filename') is the equivalent of import in Python

Finished All Assigned Exercises: 
- helloWorld
- repeatString
- reverseString
- removeFromArray
- sumAll
- leapYears
- tempConversion

Dec 2:
- changed buttons to grid squares (perhaps a regrettable design choice?)
- attempting to get rps layout on css grid 
- learned a lot about scope and closures. Still not comfortable but that's okay. 
- momentum slowed down as I grind through positioning things on the DOM
- how do I disable buttons after conditions have been met? 
- lastly, I need to decide whether I should just keep moving forward for projects or if I should absolutely go until I've finished rps. Maybe I'll give rps another few days.
- I'm sacrificing gym time for this, I better make it quality study time

Dec 3: 
- grid was a bad idea, let's go back to flexbox
- changed from buttons to divs for easier control and formatting

Dec 4:
- implemented aync await to generate a pretty text heading
- learned about CSS animations, added gradient changing background

Dec 5: 
- cleaned up code
- learned about centering
- rock paper scissors is now in alpha stages and is presentable as of now
- much more comfortable with DOM manipulation

Let's move on.

Dec 6 - Dec 12 - Project: Etch A Sketch
--
- began etch a sketch project
- learned a little bit about flexbox to make a 16x16 grid
- learned how to use mouseover combined with tag:hover to "color" in squares
- question: how do I compartmentalize my code to allow for having many buttons? 
- How do I make it clean and "contained"? 
- How do I have different n x n size grids that are contained in the same space?
- learned about event delegation. Gonna try to refactor my code so that I can apply the event listener onto the container instead of each pixel
- learned about try-catch blocks
